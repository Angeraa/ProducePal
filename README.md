# Produce Pal

Produce Pal is intended to be a tool used to find and keep track of grocery deals in the area and create a list beforehand to see how much a shopping trip for groceries would cost before even stepping out of the door. It was also meant to be a way to practice my full-stack skills and knowledge as I was learning on my own. This includes front-end with React, back-end with Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDb for the database.

## Note
As of now, I am trying to find a way to host the express app so currently the search function has nowhere to fetch from. Additionally, since this was a practice run and not a full production app, the only data for deals I have is for the postal code N2L1A1, if you might be wondering why your postal code doesn't work.
